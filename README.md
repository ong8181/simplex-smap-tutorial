# A tutorial for simplex projection and S-map
R scripts to explain the algorithms of simplex projection and S-map.
In the scripts, simplex projection (Sugihara & May 1990) and S-map (Sugihara 1994) are implemented without using existing EDM packages such as rEDM (Ye et al. 2015) or multispatialCCM (Clark et al. 2015).
